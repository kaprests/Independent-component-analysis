    "<h2>1 - Introduction</h2>\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to simulate the Cocktail party effect (CPE) with blind source separation, using independent component analysis (ICA). The CPE is a psychological effect allowing the human brain to distinguish conversations or sounds from e.g. a noisy room with several different sound sources. The noisy room is simulated with  a provided audiomix of three sources which is sepparated into independent, distinguishable sound clips using ICA. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each signal $j$ of length $T$ is described by a function $s_{j}(t),$ $t  \\epsilon [0,T]$ at time $t$. Combining the signals with weights $a_{ij}$, depending upon the distance from the source, one gets a linear combination $x_{i}$ describing the mixed sound recorded of microphone *i*. In this notebook the number of sources $j$ is assumed to be equal to the number of microphones $i$, making things a little simpler.\n",

    "\n",
    "With a digital signal each source and recording will be described by a discrete, sampled signal instead of a continious function like above. The sampled signals from all the sources and the recorded audio of all the microphones can then be described with the $dxN$ matrices <b>s</b> and <b>x</b>, with $d$ being the number of sources or microphones and $N$ the number of discrete signals determined by the length of the sound clip (s) times the sample rate (Hz).\n",

    "Independent component analysis is, as the name suggests, a way to unmix and reconstruct the original signals given signals mixed in an arbitrary or unknown way. An important assumption of the method is that the signals are statistically independent, and so the analysis is not expected to work if this is not fullfilled. It is also assumed that the signals are non-gaussian, meaning they are not distributed according to the normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to find an \"unmix matrix\" $W$ which essentially tries to transform the mixed data back into something resembling the original, unmixed signals, and since the original signals are assumed to be non-gaussian, the idea is to maximize the non-gaussianity of $y(t)$.\n",

    "Both the provided and custom audio was succesfully unmixed using the algorithm. Neat-o. \n",
    "\n",
    "By listening to the audio clips there is no immidiate difference in sepparation quality between runs using kurtosis compared to negentropy, they both generate fairly clear, separated audio with only some background noise. Performance wise the immediate impression is again that they're pretty equal, on single runs, the number of iterations using the two measurments of non-gaussianity also seems be fairly similar, and in many cases even the same. Running the separation many times though revealed that negetropy had a tendecy to perform slightly better. The code in the cell below was used to run the algoritm 100 times for both audio mixes with both kurtosis and negentropy, plotting the number of iterations in bar plots, and calculating the average number of iterations. This discussion is based on averages and plots from a prerun of the code below, which is now commented out. Uncommenting and running the cell below should produce similar results."
