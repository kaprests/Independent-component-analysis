    "<h2>1 - Introduction</h2>\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to simulate the Cocktail party effect(CPE) with blind source sepparation, using independent component analysis (ICA). The CPE is a psychological effect allowing the human brain to distinguish conversations or sounds from e.g. a noisy room with several different sound sources. The noisy room is simulated with  a provided audiomix of three sources which is sepparated into independent, distinguishable sound clips using ICA. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each signal $j$ of length $T$ is described by a function $s_{j}(t),$ $t  \\epsilon [0,T]$ at time $t$. Combining the signals with weights $a_{ij}$, depending upon the distance from the source, one gets a linear combination $x_{i}$ describing the mixed sound recorded of microphone *i*. In this notebook the number of sources $j$ is assumed to be equal to the number of microphones $i$, making things a little simpler.\n",

    "\n",
    "With a digital signal each source and recording will be described by a discrete, sampled signal instead of a continious function like above. The sampled signals from all the sources and the recorded audio of all the microphones can then be described with the $dxN$ matrixes <b>s</b> and <b>x</b>, with $d$ being the number of sources or microphones and $N$ the number of discrete signals determined by the length of the sound clip (s) times the sample rate (Hz).\n",

    "Independent component analysis is, as the name suggests, a way to unmix and reconstruct the original signals given signals mixed in an arbitrary or unknown way. An important assumtion of the method is that the signals are statistically independent, and so the analysis is not expected to work if this is not fullfilled. It is also assumed that the signals are non-gaussian, meaning they are not distributed according to the normaldistribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to find an \"unmix matrix\" $W$ which essentially tries to transform the mixed data back into something resembling the original, unmixed signals, and since the original signals are assumed to be non-gaussian, the idea is to maximize the non-gaussianity of $y(t)$.\n",

    "By listening to the audio clips there is no immidiate difference between the measurements of non-gaussianity. Based on the random matrix $W_0$ the number of iterations will also be fairly similar or even the same. To examine the difference in measurements the algorithm will be run for X iterations and plotted using the Python library Matplotlib. To ensure the following conclusion is consistent, comments will be based on pre-saved pdf-files of the plots. However, the next cell includes the code used to plot the diagrams and save them in a pdf."
